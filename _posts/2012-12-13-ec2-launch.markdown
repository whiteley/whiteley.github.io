Everyday I launch a lot of EC2 instances as part of a controlled process:

* deploying an application in the [Engine Yard Cloud][ey-cloud] Dashboard
* using the [EC2 plugin for the knife][knife-ec2] cli tool for [Opscode Chef][chef]

I also wind up running a lot of ad-hoc instances for quick experiments. This
required a frustrating multi-step dance:

0. `ec2-run-instances`
0. highlight and copy the Instance ID
0. wait long enough that networking is provisioned
0. `ec2-describe-instances` with the pasted id
0. highlight and copy the *Public DNS* attribute
0. wait long enough that sshd will be available before the connection times out
0. `ssh -oForwardAgent=yes -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ec2/keypair.pem` with the pasted hostname

Last week I got to the breaking point during one of these cycles and hacked
together a [script][gist] to launch and log into these one-off instances. The
helpful `tcp_test_ssh` and `wait_for_sshd` methods are grabbed mostly verbatim
from the previously mentioned [knife-ec2][knife-ec2] plugin.
